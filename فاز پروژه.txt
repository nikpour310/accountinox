You are GitHub Copilot Agent. Build a production-ready Persian (fa-IR, RTL) e-commerce website named “Accountinox” using Python/Django, deployable on cPanel. The site sells digital “accounts” (inventory-based digital goods). Provide a complete codebase with admin panel to manage EVERYTHING.

========================
1) TECH STACK & RULES
========================
- Backend: Python 3.11+ with Django (latest stable), Django Templates for frontend (no SPA required).
- Database: MySQL (cPanel compatible). Use django-environ for env vars.
- Auth: Django auth + django-allauth for Google login.
- Styling: Tailwind CSS.
  - Must support TWO modes switchable from Admin:
    1) Online CDN mode using: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@tailwindcss/browser@4
    2) Offline/local compiled CSS served from /static/ (prebuilt file committed)
  - Admin can toggle Tailwind mode (CDN vs local) from a “Site Settings” section.
- Theme colors based on provided logo:
  - primary: #1ABBC8
  - secondary: #0468BD
  - accent: #45E2CC
  - background white, modern clean landing.
- Security best practices: CSRF, XSS protection, secure cookies, security headers, rate limiting on auth endpoints, brute-force protection, audit logs.
- Important clarification: Users can always view client-side HTML/CSS/JS in browsers; DO NOT claim “front-end source hidden”. Instead:
  - Keep secrets on server.
  - Minify static assets.
  - Disable debug, hide stack traces, secure headers, and prevent directory listing guidance for cPanel.

========================
2) CORE FEATURES
========================
A) Landing Page (Very strong / modern)
- White/blue theme using the above palette.
- Sections: Hero + CTA, Features, How it works, Pricing teaser, Trust badges, Testimonials, FAQ, Footer.
- Global attractive header/footer reused for all pages.
- Footer must include a configurable placeholder area for “eNamad” (HTML snippet editable from admin).
- Responsive, RTL, Persian typography.

B) Authentication / Registration
- Users can register/login with:
  1) Email + password
  2) Google Account (OAuth) via django-allauth
  3) Phone number login with OTP
- OTP must be fully configurable from Admin:
  - Enable/disable OTP globally
  - Choose OTP usage: “required for phone login only” or “also required for sensitive actions”
  - OTP expiry time, max attempts, resend cooldown
- SMS sending must be via a pluggable provider interface:
  - Provide a dummy provider (console/log) + a provider stub (e.g. Kavenegar-like) with environment-based API key.
  - Admin can select provider and toggle SMS on/off.
- Account dashboard: profile, orders, purchased items, support messages.

C) E-commerce for digital accounts
- Product catalog: categories, product pages, pricing, SEO fields.
- Inventory model: each product has “Account Items” (e.g. username/password/notes) stored securely.
- Checkout flow:
  - Cart, order creation, payment initiation, payment verification callback.
  - After successful payment, allocate inventory items and show them to the user in their dashboard (and optionally email).
  - If inventory is empty, prevent purchase or show out-of-stock.
- Admin management:
  - CRUD products/categories
  - CRUD inventory items (bulk upload CSV optional)
  - Orders list, status updates, refunds flag, delivery logs
  - Discount codes (optional but preferred)

D) Payments (Iran)
- Implement payment gateway integration with a clean abstraction:
  - ZarinPal
  - Zibal
  - (Optional) generic “Bank gateway adapter” placeholder
- Admin selects active gateway and configures credentials (merchant id, etc.) via Site Settings.
- Payment callbacks routes and verification logic included.
- Store transaction logs and show in admin.

E) Blog + SEO automation
- Blog with:
  - Featured image at top, article content below, and FAQ section under each post.
  - Admin can add/edit/remove each post’s FAQ items from admin.
- SEO:
  - Auto-generate meta title/description/og tags.
  - Auto keyword extraction from post content (Persian supported best-effort):
    - Implement a simple keyword extractor in Python (e.g. YAKE-like or TF-IDF approach) executed on save.
    - Store extracted keywords in DB and allow admin override/manual edit.
  - Auto generate sitemap.xml and robots.txt.
  - Canonical URLs, slug handling.
- Add “structured data” JSON-LD for BlogPosting and FAQPage where applicable.

F) Online Support Chat (Real-time)
- Implement a support chat system:
  - Users can message support from site.
  - Admin/operator can reply inside admin panel (or dedicated operator panel).
  - Admin receives notification for new messages (in-dashboard notifications + optional email).
- Preferred: Django Channels (WebSocket). If too heavy for cPanel, provide fallback long-polling mode switchable in settings.
- Store chat history.

G) Admin Panel “manage everything”
- Provide a professional admin UI:
  - Either customize Django admin with a modern theme OR build a custom admin dashboard app.
- Admin must manage:
  - Site Settings (colors, tailwind mode, logos, header/footer links, eNamad html, gateways, OTP, SMS provider)
  - Users & roles (admin, operator)
  - Products, inventory, orders, payments
  - Blog posts + FAQs per post
  - Global FAQs (landing)
  - Support chats

========================
3) PROJECT STRUCTURE & DELIVERABLES
========================
Create a clean repo:
- accountinox/
  - config/ (settings, urls, wsgi/asgi)
  - apps/
    - core (site settings, pages, header/footer, faq)
    - accounts (auth, otp, google login)
    - shop (products, inventory, cart, orders, payments)
    - blog (posts, categories, per-post faq, seo extractor)
    - support (chat, notifications)
  - templates/ (base, landing, shop, blog, dashboard, support)
  - static/ (local tailwind build, images, js)
  - docs/
    - DEPLOY_CPANEL.md (step-by-step cPanel Python setup)
    - SECURITY.md
- Provide fixtures or seed command to create initial admin and demo data.
- Provide tests for critical flows: auth, otp, checkout, payment verification mock, inventory allocation.

========================
4) CPANEL DEPLOYMENT REQUIREMENTS (MUST)
========================
In docs/DEPLOY_CPANEL.md include:
- How to use cPanel “Setup Python App”
- Virtualenv creation, pip install -r requirements.txt
- Configure Passenger WSGI entry
- Set env vars (DJANGO_SECRET_KEY, DEBUG=0, ALLOWED_HOSTS, DB creds, gateway creds)
- Collectstatic
- Migrate
- Media/static handling on cPanel
- Allowed hosts & HTTPS guidance

========================
5) IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
========================
- Use environment variables for secrets; never hardcode credentials.
- Add rate limiting (e.g. django-ratelimit) for login/otp endpoints.
- OTP codes stored hashed; log attempts.
- Use secure storage for inventory items:
  - Encrypt sensitive fields at rest (use Fernet with key from env) OR at least protect via server-only access.
- Provide admin toggles for: OTP enable, Tailwind mode, Gateway select, Chat mode (WS/long-poll).

========================
6) ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
========================
- Runs locally with mysql or sqlite fallback.
- Works on cPanel with MySQL.
- Admin can control site settings fully.
- Registration supports Google + phone OTP + password login.
- Blog auto extracts keywords and generates SEO meta + sitemap.
- Checkout integrates ZarinPal and Zibal with adapter interface and logs.
- Support chat works and notifies admin.
- Landing is modern and uses the palette.

Now implement the complete project with production-ready code, migrations, templates, docs, and a clear README with setup steps.
